# iex-realm-service
## Integrates IEX to Realm cloud db for the Mobile integration

1. Integrates from IEX to Realm DB cloud solution
2. Cron iteration to get latest news
3. Listener - Documentation needs a better explanantion with pics for permissions on classes, realms etc

#### NOTES
1. Always use default admin in POC
2. Create the realms '/realm-name'
3. When I used the user/password and creating the data, the realms are getting created inside /default Listener could not get realm.objects(). paths are uuid based
4. If you created by hand, upgrade the realms to reference from full.
